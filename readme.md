# Building Security System
The designed system can be used in different branches of a company. It is responsible for tracking the attendance of the employees using RFID cards. Also, a smart fire alarm which monitors the level of poisonous gases in each floor activates an alarm (buzzer and led) whenever it detects fire and informs other branches about the accident. The alarm is active until the building is evacuated. Once nobody is inside, the system activates a relay that sucks out the oxygen. 
Through the keypad, the administrator can enter a code to turn the system off, or test it. 
During an accident, all other branches stay updated.

The simulation is also provided. (Proteus)
